Day 2 Git Flow – Command Paths
Step 1 – Initialize repository
cd ~/Desktop/Devops/GIT       # Navigate to your project folder
git init                      # Initialize Git repo
git branch -M main            # Rename default branch to main

Step 2 – Check status (optional but recommended)
git status                    # See untracked or staged files

Step 3 – Create files
echo "This is my first file" > readme.txt
echo "This is my second file" > readme2.txt

Step 4 – Stage files
git add readme.txt             # Stage readme.txt
git add readme2.txt            # Stage readme2.txt
# OR stage all changes at once:
git add .

Step 5 – Commit changes
git commit -m "Added readme files"   # Save staged files to history


Tip: The text after -m is just a message describing your commit.

Step 6 – Check commit history
git log --graph --oneline --all    # See commits in a tree-like structure
git show HEAD                      # Optional: see what changed in the last commit

Step 7 – Check project structure
tree -L 2                          # Visualize folder & file layout

Step 8 – Branching (optional enhancement)
git branch dev                     # Create a new branch for experiments
git checkout dev                   # Switch to dev branch

Step 9 – Undo mistakes (optional enhancement)
git reset HEAD <file>              # Unstage a file if added by mistake
git revert <commit-id>             # Undo a commit safely


✅ This is your Day 2 flow in proper order with optional commands added.
